# a-frame-walkabout
A-Frame implementation of [the "Walkabout" XR locomotion](https://youtu.be/pW6nlLV88Zk?t=15).

Basically, you go back and forth from one end of your designated area to another and rotate the scene
when you reach the guardian boundary.

Tested on the Oculus Quest 2.
Rotate by bare hand pinching or pressing the "hold" button on a controller.

Test it [here](https://www.timatimak.eu/experiments/a-frame-walkabout/index.html).
